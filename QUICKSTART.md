# Quickstart

Clone [the SDK repository](https://github.com/revdoku/revdoku-python) and enter its directory.

Requires Python 3.10 or newer. From the cloned package directory:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install .
```

Set `REVDOKU_API_KEY` in your environment.

## List mailboxes

After source installation and credential setup, run this from the package directory:

```sh
python examples/list_mailboxes.py
```

This makes one read request and prints each visible mailbox's ID and email address:

```text
bkt_RETURNED_ID example@revdokumail.com
```

[Runnable source](examples/list_mailboxes.py). Reuse one of these mailboxes for the email walkthrough; this request does not create a mailbox or consume creation capacity.

Keep the SDK's default API origin, `https://api.revdoku.com`. Its paths already include `/v1`; setting the SDK base to the REST base `https://api.revdoku.com/v1` would duplicate that prefix.
`REVDOKU_ACCOUNT_ID` is optional and selects an account granted to the key; otherwise its default account applies.
The response retains the API's `data` envelope. Copy one returned mailbox `id` into `REVDOKU_BUCKET_ID` for the walkthrough. An empty mailbox list means there are no visible active mailboxes for this key and account.
